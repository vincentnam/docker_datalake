# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Environment variables

You can also create temporary environment variables using the terminal or by creating necessary file.

The 1st method consists of launching these commands below, depending of your Operating System.

For Windows:

Command : set "REACT_APP_SERVER_NAME=server_name" (replace server_name by the real server name).

For Linux:

Command : set "REACT_APP_SERVER_NAME=server_name" (replace server_name by the real server name).

The 2nd method consists of creating .env at the root of React project on the same model as .env.sample . You will have to reboot React project if its container is launched yet.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'docker-compose up --build'

Runs the command `npm start` in the Docker container the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

All the commands below have to be ran in the container. You can access it by :
    1) the software Docker by selecting the "datalake-react-front" container and clicking on "CLI" button,
    2) launching the command "docker exec -it react bash" in Unix systems

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
